	Billy: As a vegan restaurant owner I want to see on a map in which area my customers live in order to plan where I should open my next location.

	Melisandra: As a priestess to the lord of light, I want to create user profiles based on multiple characteristics/attributes to help me narrow down where I should search for people to convert.

	V: As a revolutionary (on a time-crunch), I would like to create an account so that my user profiles are saved for later and I dont have to re-create each profile when planning my coup.

	Khaleesi: As the mother of dragons and one true queen, I would like for the map to have simple filters so I can easily understand the demographics in each area of my newly conquered cities. The map should be shaded to illustrate the population density based on the atributes I am looking for.
