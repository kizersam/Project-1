# Project-1

1. This tool allows users to map out where different demographic and consumer segments live in the San Francisco Bay Area using
over 70,000 US Government census surveys which include demographic, social, employment, and health data.
Companies or government agencies can create a "consumer profile" which accept multiple parameters and then map out areas of high
density for these segments. It can be used for a wide range of purposes such as demographic studies for social programs, 
market segmentation, targeted marketing campaigns, and labor force recruitment.

4.Billy: As a vegan restaurant owner I want to see on a map in which area my customers live in order to plan where I should open my next location.

	Melisandra: As a priestess to the lord of light, I want to create user profiles based on multiple characteristics/attributes to help me narrow down where I should search for people to convert.

	V: As a revolutionary (on a time-crunch), I would like to create an account so that my user profiles are saved for later and I dont have to re-create each profile when planning my coup.

	Khaleesi: As the mother of dragons and one true queen, I would like for the map to have simple filters so I can easily understand the demographics in each area of my newly conquered cities. The map should be shaded to illustrate the population density based on the atributes I am looking for.


5.Coming soon. Will be one to many when I allow users to create accounts that allow them to save their customer segments.

6. Google Maps/Heatmaps Api and US Government Census API

7. There is still a long way to go for me. I want to create a map that can immediately filter after a parameter is selected.
I would algo like to add more longitudinal data and allow users to create accounts in order to save their customer segment
criteria.
